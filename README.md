## pk-web

[Live Demo](http://pk-web.jasonmh.me/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/SEAKING-LOVE/pk-web)

The front-end project. Using our own API, we created a responsive Pok√©dex as a way to demonstrate what is capable using just our API as the sole data source. In trying to use the most modern technology available at the time, this project was built using React 16, Redux 3, React-Router 4, webpack 3, and Redux-Saga. 


## pk-api

[Live Demo](http://pk-api.jasonmh.me/v1/pokemon/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/SEAKING-LOVE/pk-api)

The back-end project. Using data from veekun, we created and hosted our own Postgres database. This data is made accessible through our custom API layer that we wrote using Node and Express.

## pk-scripts

[Source Code](https://github.com/SEAKING-LOVE/pk-scripts)

A collection of quick scripts that we used to help speed up the development process. For example, one script that you'll find in here is one that we used to rename our animated gif sprites to match our naming convention. 


## pk-assets

[Source Code](https://github.com/SEAKING-LOVE/pk-assets)

All of the assets that we use in [pk-web](#pk-web). This repo exists to reduce load on our humble little VPS.
